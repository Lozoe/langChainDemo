      "Here are several strong, memorable, and culturally appropriate English name suggestions for a company specializing in **广告设计 (advertising design)** — balancing creativity, professionalism, and market appeal (especially for bilingual or international clients):\n",
      "\n",
      "### Top Recommendations:\n",
      "1. **Lumina Studio**  \n",
      "   *Why it works:* “Lumina” evokes light, clarity, and impact — essential for compelling ads. Short, elegant, globally pronounceable, and subtly suggests *illuminating* brands. Works well in both English and Chinese contexts (sounds refined, not literal).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Verve Creative**  \n",
      "   *Why it works:* “Verve” means energy, spirit, and flair — perfectly capturing the dynamism of great advertising design. Professional yet vibrant; easy to trademark and brand.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Astra AdCraft**  \n",
      "   *Why it works:* “Astra” (Latin for “stars”) conveys aspiration, visibility, and standout results; “AdCraft” clearly signals expertise in advertising *craftsmanship*. Modern, tech-adjacent but human-centered.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Nexus Visual Co.**  \n",
      "   *Why it works:* “Nexus” implies connection — between brand and audience, idea and execution. “Visual” grounds it in design; clean, trustworthy, and scalable beyond just ads (e.g., branding, digital, print).\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Hui Design Group** (慧设计集团)  \n",
      "   *Why it works:* “Hui” (Chinese: 慧) means wisdom, insight, and intelligence — reflecting strategic, thoughtful ad design. Pronounced “hway”, it’s short, meaningful, culturally rooted, and easily localized (e.g., Hui Design | 慧设计). Ideal if targeting Chinese-speaking markets or emphasizing East-West synergy.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Bonus (Playful & Memorable):\n",
      "- **Pixel & Pulse** — Suggests digital precision + human resonance. Great for modern, media-savvy brands.  \n",
      "- **Chroma Lab** — “Chroma” = color/vibrancy; “Lab” implies innovation and experimentation. Stylish and design-forward.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Naming Tips for Your Context:\n",
      "- ✅ **Avoid direct translations** like “AdDesign Co.” — they sound generic and lack memorability.  \n",
      "- ✅ **Prioritize names that are easy to spell, say, and search** — especially important for SEO and word-of-mouth.  \n",
      "- ✅ **Check domain & trademark availability** (e.g., lumina.studio, vervecreative.com).  \n",
      "- ✅ **Test with your target audience** — e.g., does “Hui Design” resonate with clients in Shanghai? Does “Lumina” feel premium to global startups?\n",
      "\n",
      "Would you like help with:  \n",
      "🔹 A Chinese name (with English transliteration & meaning)?  \n",
      "🔹 Tagline ideas to match one of these names?  \n",
      "🔹 Logo concept or brand voice guidance?  \n",
      "\n",
      "Happy to refine based on your brand personality (e.g., bold & disruptive vs. elegant & strategic) or market focus (e.g., local SMEs in Guangzhou vs. global tech clients).\n"
